# Klipper Configs

This is a collection of the config files I'm currently using for Klipper. Printer-specific `printer.cfg` files are in folders, but the `.cfg` files in the root are universal.

Note: `include` directives in the printer configs assume that the included files (`menu.cfg`, etc.) are all in the same directory as `printer.cfg`.
